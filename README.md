<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fede</h1>

<br>

<h3 align="left">I'm a MERN Full Stack Web Developer</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on [IronHack Barcelona](https://www.ironhack.com/en/barcelona) as a Teacher Assistant for the full time Web Development bootcamps.
  
- :star2: My main stack includes **ES6** JavaScript, **React** for front-end development (with **Hooks** and **Redux**/Context for state management), with **SASS** in modules for styling. For back-end development I usually use **Node**, **Express** and **MongoDB**.
  
- :rocket: Huge fan of **Next.js** and in my most recent projects I'm moving towards *TypeScript*, *Styled-Components* for visuals and *GraphQL* to explore beyond the REST API development model.
  
- :hear_no_evil: With a closer look at [my career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fede-muniente/) you will find a background as a Journalist and Content Manager, so I like to think that I am fluent in both the *content* and *container* parts of development.
    
- :see_no_evil: By the way, despite being quite verbose in my presentation, I like to keep my code lean and clean!
  
- :speak_no_evil: You can connect with me here: [![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Github-000?style=flat&logo=Github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/fmp0830)[![Linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fede-muniente/)
